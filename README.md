### Hi I am Phil!

My name is Phil Huddy and I am a student at Drexel University pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering and an MS in Machine Learning Engineering.

Currently I am working on a django website for Drexel Theta Tau, a professional engineering fraternity that I am in. I am also working on a Discord Bot with a friend, although at the moment we are just playing around with it and it does nothing.

In the past, I developed a survey and test-takinf program in Java as a homework assignment for a class on object oriented programming. I also worked with a team to develop a browser game using the Phaser framework that was a Minecraft-themed platformer for a class on web development.

If you would like to see the code for any of these projects and don't see a repo for it, shoot me an email and I will give you access to the repo or point you to where you can find it!

In addition to coding, I love playing basketball and football, as well as watching them both, going snowboarding, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.

You can reach me by emailing philip.huddy@drexel.edu
